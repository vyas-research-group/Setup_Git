# Checking_the_status_of_files

It can be easy to forget what changes you have made recently and whether you have staged (added) them for the next commit. this is easily checked with the git status command:

```git
git status
```

This will show you what files you have changed and a broad overview of what types of changes you have made.

If you are interested in exact changes you can use the following commands

```git
git diff
```

```git
git diff <file_name_here>
```

These will show the exact changes you have made to all files and a set/specific file(s) respectively

to exit just press "q".
