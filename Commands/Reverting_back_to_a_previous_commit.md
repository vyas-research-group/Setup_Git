# Reverting_back_to_a_previous_commit

If you, or someone else makes a mistake and you need to go back to before that happened. Don't panic. This is exactly what git was made for. We simply use the git checkout command:
```git
git checkout Commit_String_Here
```

The commit sting is the list of yellow/brownish numbers and letters you see in the git log examples in [[Checking_the_commit_log]].

You can then make changes you want if any and commit them as before.
