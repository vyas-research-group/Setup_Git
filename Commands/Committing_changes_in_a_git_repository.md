# Committing_changes_in_a_git_repository
Committing is the heart of what git is all about. Once you have made your changes to a repository and staged them you need to commit them so that they are tracked. To commit them use the following command:

```git
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

the `-m` flag allows you to add a message to the commit. ==This is very important.== Later, if you decide you want to go back to before you made those changes you will want a descriptive message that describes exactly what changes were made. This will be your only hint to yourself and others later so make it descriptive. **Messages like "Should work now" or "Changed to a more spicy basis set" are not helpful.**
