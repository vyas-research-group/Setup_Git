# Pulling_from_a_github_repository

**This section assumes you have a [[Remotes_and_git|remote]] and it is called origin.**

Eventually, if you are working in a team you will want to get any updates from the github repository that others might have made. To do this you need to use the pull command.

```git 
git pull origin
```

You may also want to pull from a specific branch on the github repo and this is just as easy:
```git
git pull origin example_branch_name
```
