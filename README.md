# How to get this repo before you have git:

Up and to the right of this repo there should be a ==Bright Green== "<> Code" button.
The drop down from it will have a zip file download.

Once downloaded unzip the file into it's own directory.

Everything else I will be demonstrating will be designed to be  shown in a vanilla obsidian vault. If you so not have obsidian you can download it for free [here](https://obsidian.md/download).

# Opening an obsidian vault:
When you are first open obsidian you are greeted with a screen with a list of options. 
Choose the option that says "Open folder as vault".
Then select the directory/folder you unzipped the github folder into.
I will not be going into further detail on the ends of outs of obsidian here.
If you are interested in more features from obsidian there is a very informative youtube video [here](https://youtu.be/WqKluXIra70?si=27lPegnT8Z1urN12).

For now all you need to know is that obsidian uses Markdown which is a light weight human readable markup language. This means you can store your notes in plain text which takes up very little storage space on your device.

There is ample documentation online for markdown and [Obsidian flavored Markdown](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax)
