# Creating_a_git_repository_(repo)

Any folder on a machine can be a git repository. When you are creating a git repository you are telling git "Keep track of all the changes I make in this directory/folder" the way you do that is by, in your terminal `cd`ing into the directory you want to keep track of changes. and using the command:
```git
git init
```

if you check the directory you will find a new folder titled `.git`. if you ever want to make a directory no longer a repository all you need to do it delete/remove the `.git` directory/folder.
