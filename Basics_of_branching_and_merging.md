Branching is an especially useful feature of git.

By default (with a few exceptions) you will be on the "main" branch.

The main branch is typically where the most recent stable version goes.

If you plan on making a modification to a repo it is best to work on a branch for that specific modification.

You can create a branch from any other branch so if you want to experiment with different options on a feature branch you can create branches off of that as well.

Once you are done modifying your branch and you are prepared for it to be part of the the main branch or another branch it is time to merge it
